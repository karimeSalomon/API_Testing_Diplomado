Practice 2:
    Create a function that receive 3 arguments :
        -     2 numbers
        -     1 operations
    According the operation defined the expected result need to be printed. For example :  operator “*” , numbers: “5” “6”, perform_operation(“*”,”5”,”6”) => 30

Practice 3:
        -  Create python script applying at least one time each one of the operators learned.
        -  Print the values and the condition that give you the result obtained.
