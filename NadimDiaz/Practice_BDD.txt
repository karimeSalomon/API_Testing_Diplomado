#When and why BDD was defined?
BDD or Behavior-driven development (BDD) is a Software development methodology. 
The idea is to get an application based on the specifications and design (this last based on final user usage).
We all that had experience working with Software development knows the big issues that we have when we provided a feature that worked in a different way that our costumer expected. A lot of times this happens because a lack of requirements and specification definitions. BDD tries to help here, and basically make our implementation dependent of the design / requirements.

# The most important aspects of BDD
Advantages:
-Improves knowledge about business logic in the team, also improves communication inside the team. 
-Reduces regression, if the tests are continuously executed (with proper configuration of CI/CD), we'll be sure that on regression we'll not have surprises.
Dis advantages:
-This all is based on specification, so, if we don’t have requirements or design very well defined, we’ll go into a problem. We’ll need to go with the team, sit and define all the needed. This is time and resources, if we have a PO (as we talked in classes) this helps a lot, more if this PO has well defined his tasks.
-We also need a continuous feedback and review from the team. This is basically one more project that needs refactoring (when changes coming) and maintenance.

#Why is useful and when could be applied?
Mentioning some details on advantages and also on the next question.

# Which type of teams could implement BDD
Teams that are dispose to: 
-collaboration (since we need a lot of work with stakeholders, testing team, etc)
-focus on end users, BDD puts the customer’s por of view as main vision in mind first.
-work on their business values.

STRUCTURE OF A FEATURE
Name: Search for books
Size: 5 points
Priority: High

STORY:
As a student
I want to search a book in the application
So that I know the store has it and the details about it

SCENARIO:
Given I logged in as Student
When I search for “Agatha Christie: 10 porkies” book in the application
Then I found information about the book

#Differences between BDD and BDT
The big difference is that BDT is most commonly worked in the teams, since who performs this is a special team instead of the development team. (Devs aren’t part of BDT)
